These improvements drove a 25% increase in on-time service reliability, reduced scheduling conflicts by 40%, and enhanced overall customer satisfaction ratings.\n\n\nContinuous Improvement & Stakeholder Engagement\nBeyond day-to-day operations, I facilitated regular stakeholder reviews—presenting data-driven insights, gathering frontline feedback, and implementing iterative enhancements. My collaboration with drivers, clients, and management teams fostered a culture of continuous improvement that sustained long-term operational excellence."
