Each project underscores my commitment to safety, efficiency, and exceptional customer experiences.\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n| Metric                          | Baseline | Improved |\n| ------------------------------- | -------: | -------: |\n| Monthly Class Enrollment        |       20 |       26 |\n| Course Completion Rate (%)      |       80 |       95 |\n| On-Time Service Reliability (%) |       75 |       94 |\n| Monthly Scheduling Conflicts    |       15 |        9 |\n\n![](images/operations_metrics.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\n## Case Studies\n\n### Diving Instruction Program  \nLeading instruction at a premier diving center in Kuwait, I crafted a progressive training curriculum combining theoretical briefings with practical pool and open-water sessions. By standardizing daily safety checks and mentor-led skill assessments, I increased class enrollment by 30% and achieved a 95% course completion rate—boosting client retention and word-of-mouth referrals.\n\n### Transportation Operations Transformation  \nAs Operations Manager for my family’s transportation business, I spearheaded a cross-functional revamp of scheduling and dispatch workflows. I introduced real-time tracking, customer feedback surveys, and a performance dashboard to monitor key metrics. These improvements drove a 25% increase in on-time service reliability, reduced scheduling conflicts by 40%, and enhanced overall customer satisfaction ratings.\n\n### Continuous Improvement & Stakeholder Engagement  \nBeyond day-to-day operations, I facilitated regular stakeholder reviews—presenting data-driven insights, gathering frontline feedback, and implementing iterative enhancements. My collaboration with drivers, clients, and management teams fostered a culture of continuous improvement that sustained long-term operational excellence.\n",
