Below are selected projects that showcase my strategic marketing expertise drawn from prior experiences in immersive sports engagement and fitness technology. Each case study highlights how I blend data-driven insights, creative storytelling, and cross-channel coordination to drive growth and deepen audience connections.

## MLB VR Fan Engagement Campaign

**Context:** During my MBA capstone project, I led the marketing rollout for a Virtual Reality fan experience in partnership with Major League Baseball. Our goal was to expand the reach of live games to tech-savvy audiences and create new sponsorship opportunities.

**Approach:** - Developed segmented personas (e.g., casual fans, tech enthusiasts, out-of-town supporters) to tailor messaging. - Crafted a multi-channel launch plan including social teasers, influencer partnerships, and in-stadium QR promotions. - Established real-time performance dashboards to track impressions, click-through rates, and signups.

**Results & Impact:** - Achieved a 40% lift in pre-launch registrations versus target. - Drove 25K new VR app downloads within the first month. - Secured three new sponsor activations valued at \$150K in incremental revenue.

## Peloton Community Expansion Strategy

**Context:** As part of a strategic consulting engagement with Peloton, I designed a growth strategy to deepen member engagement and cross-sell digital subscriptions.

**Approach:** - Conducted customer journey mapping to identify engagement drop-off points. - Launched targeted email and in-app campaigns promoting virtual events and challenges. - Collaborated with creative teams to produce video testimonials and user-generated content for social channels. - Implemented A/B testing on email subject lines and push notifications to optimize open and conversion rates.

**Results & Impact:** - Increased digital subscription conversions by 18% month-over-month. - Boosted in-app community interactions by 35%, measured through forum posts and challenge participation. - Elevated email open rates from 20% to 28% and click-through rates from 3.5% to 5.2%.
